# Modular Neural Networks for Anomaly Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems

This is the repository for our publication *Using Modular Neural Networks for Anomaly Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems*.

## Overview

We use Modular Neural Networks to model the inner dependencies of Cyber-Physical System (CPS) subsystems.
Thereby, we can achieve a more robust detection of anomalies in CPS and a better allocation of their root-causes.
For further information, we recommend you to read our [publication(#citation)].

## Requirements

We recommend Anaconda to install all requirements for our repository.
The requirements are saved in the `venv.yml` file. 

For a quick installation run: `conda env create -f venv.yml`

## Replication

As empirical validation dataset, we used the robot-anomaly dataset of [Grabaek et al. 2023](https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2023.3289068). 
You can access and download the dataset [here](https://zenodo.org/record/5849300).
Once you downloaded the dataset, save it in the `./data` directory.

For replicating the results from our paper, run the `main.py` script from the `./code` directory.
The script will run the reproducible hyperparameter search, as well as the subsequent replication studies, and evaluation studies.

By running the `./exp/exp_setup/evaluation.ipynb`, you can calculate the metrics from the paper.

You can run your own studies by uncommenting the suitable codeblock in the `main.py` script.
